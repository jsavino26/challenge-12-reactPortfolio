# Personal Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website built with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The site showcases my journey from an aircraft mechanic with 15 years of experience in aviation to a budding web developer. The website includes sections for "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and more, and it is fully responsive, meaning it looks great on devices of all sizes.
