        <p>Hi, I'm Jennifer Savino, a passionate web developer making a career change from aviation. With 15 years of experience as an aircraft mechanic, I’m now diving into the world of coding. I’m learning JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and I’m excited to expand my skills and knowledge in development. While coding presents its challenges, it’s incredibly rewarding, and I’m enjoying every step of this new journey. I look forward to learning more programming languages and development tools as I grow in this field!</p>
